•	Created a helmet detection system using YOLOv3 object detection algorithm as a member of my team   
•	Used python language to create this project that can efficiently identify the person with helmet. 
•	Collected raw images and then created a dataset using Roboflow to annotate each image and draw a bounding box around each object
